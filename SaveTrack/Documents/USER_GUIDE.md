## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Streak Not Updating

**Problem:** Streak shows 0 days even though you've logged entries.

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're logging at least one entry per day
- Check that entries are being saved (view History)
- Streak requires consecutive days - missing a day resets it
- Close and reopen the app to refresh

#### Goals Not Showing Progress

**Problem:** Goal progress bar doesn't update after adding entries.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure entries are within the goal's date range
- Check that the goal period (monthly/yearly) matches your entries
- Goals created later will include past entries from the start date
- Try refreshing by closing and reopening the app

#### Categories Not Appearing

**Problem:** Categories don't show in the entry form.

**Solutions:**
- Close and reopen the app
- Check Settings → Categories to verify categories exist
- If still missing, delete and reinstall the app (export data first!)

#### Currency Not Changing

**Problem:** Currency setting doesn't update amounts.

**Solutions:**
- Close and reopen the app
- Check Settings → Currency is set correctly
- All amounts should update automatically

#### App Crashes

**Problem:** App crashes when opening or using features.

**Solutions:**
- Force close the app and reopen
- Restart your iPhone
- Check that you're running iOS 15.0 or later

#### Data Not Saving

**Problem:** Entries disappear after closing the app.

**Solutions:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use SaveTrack on multiple devices?

Currently, SaveTrack stores data locally on each device. To sync between devices:
1. Export data from Device 1
2. Import data on Device 2
3. Repeat as needed

**Note:** This creates separate copies, not true sync. Future versions may include optional cloud sync.

### What happens if I delete the app?

All data is deleted when you uninstall the app. **Always export your data before deleting!**

### How long are streaks tracked?

Streaks are tracked indefinitely. Your longest streak is saved permanently. Current streaks reset if you miss a day.

### Can I edit past entries?

Yes! Tap any entry in History to edit or delete it. Changes update your totals and goals automatically.

### Do goals expire?

Goals don't expire unless you set an end date. Monthly goals reset each month, yearly goals reset each year.

### Can I change a goal after creating it?

Currently, goals cannot be edited after creation. Delete and recreate the goal if needed. Future versions may include goal editing.

### How do I share my achievements?

When you achieve a goal or earn a badge, tap the "Share" button to:
- Share to social media
- Save to Photos
- Send via Messages or Email
- Share via AirDrop

### What's the difference between templates and categories?
